# Totally Wicked Test-23
MVC Application to navigate and display information from the Rick and Morty public API. 

### Overview
Whilst I understand what an MVC is I had no real production experience in using modern frameworks such as Laravel. I decided to spend the weekend doing some basic MVC training and putting together my own lightweight vanilla PHP/MVC Framework which included some core functionality for the framework itself and added my own Controllers, Models and Views for the front end.

### Challenges
- Initially I thought that an MVC approach from scratch was overkill for the requirements of the test. However, I thought it would be a truer reflection of my ability to adapt and learn rather than make a poor attempt at using a framework and not understanding the core architecture itself.
- I also had to make a choice between the decoupling the front end and using either JS library such as React or View to make the requests. I decided against this as I also realised, I needed to keep to a respectable time scale and keep my approach simple. 

### Things I would like to have done differently
- If I had the time I would have preferred to add grunt to compile my CSS and JS directly instead of sourcing from a CDN or simply downloading the bootstrap stylesheets. 
- I would have liked to have populated all filters with fixed values rather than use search inputs. 
- I would have liked to improve the security of the POST values from the search forms. 

### Final Thoughts
I spent a great deal more time on the task than was suggested (2-3 hours). Most of that time was spent on learning the MVC architecture and developing my own framework. However, once the framework was complete, adding the controllers, models and views for each section of the site took very little time at all. Overall, I’m satisfied that I completed the challenge, I’m happy that I've learned some new skills and regardless of my success with the application process, I’m happy that I’ve had a positive and productive few days.
